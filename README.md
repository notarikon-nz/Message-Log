# Message-Log
Very quick & dirty inverted roguelike-esque message log for Godot

Set the **MessageLogSize** to the number of visible lines you want to have (or make this an editor-visible setting)

Use the function addline() to push messages to the log, it will automatically wrap if it exceeds the length of the node.

The reducing opacity of the text is calculated automatically
